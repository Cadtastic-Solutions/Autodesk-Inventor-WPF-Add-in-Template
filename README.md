# Autodesk-Inventor-WPF-Add-in-Template
An Autodesk Inventor WPF based add-in template with wizard interface.

A WPF add-in template for Autodesk Inventor. The template should be available as a downloadable Visual Studio package including the main template and other reusable Item templates. The initial project creation will include a template wizard that the user will fill out to aid rapid creation of an out-of-the-box working add-in. The goal is to provide a solution in which any developer can get up and running quickly without having to focus on the initial setup of an add-in.
